                Since the COVID pandemic began to flip everything upside-down, 
                I have spent my time in quarantine focusing on becoming a well-rounded programmer. 
                The technologies that I feel most comfortable with are React, Node.js/Express, and MongoDB. 
                Although I have a solid understanding of React, I particularly enjoy building REST API's 
                and doing backend projects. I feel very comfortable troubleshooting code and figuring out why something does not 
                work the way that it should.
                
                One of the reasons why I am making this career change to web development is that 
                I aspire to work on projects that change how we live our everyday lives, something that web development is a major part of in today's world.
