                    <li style="margin-bottom: 7px"><b>Sequelize Databases</b> - Although I prefer non-sequel databases, I want to understand the mechanics of SQL in the event I encounter a problem that would be better solved by relational data structures.</li>
                    <li><b>React Native</b> - In the last 10 years alone, mobile devices have become a dependency for the majority of the world. By learning React Native, I could develop applications that are used by many in their daily lives.</li>
