        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            As I am currently transitioning into web development, my professional experience with developing software 
            is limited. My experience teaching English did give me various soft skills 
            that would prove useful in this field. During the pandemic, I have been dedicating 
            myself to writing web applications at a professional level.

            <h3>English teacher @ Althus English</h3>
            <h4>JAN 2020 - APR 2020</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Taught English in Brazil to professional students. Typically, the students were beginners or 
                learning intermediate level business English. One student who went on a business trip to England 
                mentioned how she could understand conversations much better after lessons with me.

            <h4>NOV 2018 - JUN 2019</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Facilitated English learning for students at a variety of different levels in Chiclayo, Peru. 
                I created my own assignments, lessons, and curriculum for students to improve their English. 
                My main focus was to improve their conversational skills, namely listening and speaking.
